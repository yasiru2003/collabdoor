I need to provide the full code for `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`, but I don't have the original file content to know what to replace. Since the AI's response only mentioned fixing the welcome message to use `user.email?.split('@')[0]` instead of `user.name`, I'll need to make an educated guess about what the full file might contain.

However, without seeing the original file, I can't provide a complete replacement that would be safe to copy and paste. The AI's response only showed a small snippet of the change needed.

To properly help you, I would need to see the original content of `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`. Without that, I can only provide a partial solution focused on the welcome message change, which wouldn't be a complete file you could copy and paste.

If you can share the original file content, I'd be happy to provide the complete updated code.
